# About Me

I'm passionate about user interfaces and the way people interact with technology. My goal is to create systems that are not only technically robust but also to rhyme with the humans that use them. I'm particularly interested in how technology can be harnessed to address environmental and social challenges.

I studied Physics at the University of Birmingham, and have worked in various technology jobs since. I've had the pleasure to work with some brilliant colleagues and customers in industries including cybersecurity, automotive, financial services, broadcast and energy & utilities. Currently, I work as a prototype architect at Amazon Web Services, helping customers figure out *what* to build and then collaboratively building it. I also enjoy tinkering on my own pet projects.

I live just outside London in St Albans. I enjoy getting outside for a run or a cycle when I'm not typing. 
My dream is to open an Italian bakery/caf√© serving the best focaccia & coffee.
